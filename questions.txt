1. Are "double" and "Double" equivalent? It appears they are interoperable, but is one a "primative" while the other is a class?
I've seen similar with how C# treats "string" and "String". (NEVERMIND, I read further in the README!)

2. Is the instance initializer necessaary with the constructor present?

3. Is the instance initializer handled before or after the constructor?

4. More an observation: why does Java require a string literal for the super constructor? I feel like taking the type name would
make more sense (a la Python).

5. Is Java's "abstract" somewhat equivalent to "virtual" in C++?

6. Does the try...catch block have performance implications?

7. How does scope work in try...catch? Is there a hidden lexical scope higher than the try block?
